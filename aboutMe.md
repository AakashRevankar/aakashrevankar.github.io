I graduated with a Master’s degree in Electronics Information and Computational Engineering from Trinity College Dublin. I also completed my Bachelor’s degree in Physical Science from a college affiliated with Bengaluru City University.

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in both Electronics and Computer Science. My project on Arduino UNO taught me the practical application of coding in home automation and robotics. This experience sparked my passion for exploring machine learning algorithms, as I was fascinated by their potential applications across various domains. Throughout my Master’s studies, I focused on implementing machine learning algorithms in signal processing systems, including Bayesian matting, clustering, regression, and classification.

After graduation, I expanded my skill set to include database management, advanced statistical tools, and data analysis. I am also currently deepening my knowledge of data structures through online platforms. My thesis involved developing deep learning algorithms from scratch using Python, Keras TensorFlow and OpenCV to create and compare interactive image colorization systems, enabling users to efficiently colorize entire images with minimal input.

In addition to these skills, I have experience in data analysis and applying machine learning techniques to practical problems, making me well-prepared to contribute to innovative projects in these areas.

On this website, you will find more details about my projects, thesis, and ways to connect with me online.
